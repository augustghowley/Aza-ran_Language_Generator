## **Aza'ra: Threads of Fate (Book Series)**
### **A Six-Book Fantasy Sci-Fi Series by August G. Howley**

Pix never expected to be anything more than another face lost in the crowds of Earth‚Äôs forgotten. A **non-binary wheelchair user**, they‚Äôve spent years surviving on the streets, building a family out of the broken and abandoned‚Äîuntil a hidden portal pulls them into the ancient world of **Aza‚Äôra**, a realm where **magic, gods, and advanced technology** have intertwined for millennia.

But Aza‚Äôra is on the brink of collapse. A **false ruler clings to power**, rebellion stirs in the shadows, and the world‚Äôs fragile balance teeters as forgotten portals between realms begin to fracture. When Pix discovers they are more than just a lost traveler‚Äîthat they were **born in Aza‚Äôra, tied by blood and destiny to the throne itself**‚Äîthey are thrust into a conflict spanning **galaxies, timelines, and magic itself**.

Betrayal, war, and impossible choices haunt them as an **ancient force moves unseen, unraveling the very fabric of reality**. With found family turning into lost souls and enemies wearing the faces of friends, Pix must decide whether to fight for a world that has already cost them everything‚Äîor flee, and let fate take its course.

As **gods fall and civilizations burn**, the veil between worlds shatters. And when the last thread of fate unravels, who‚Äîif anyone‚Äîwill be left to pick up the pieces?
